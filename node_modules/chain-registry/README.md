A unified store of chains info, assets, asset lists, and IBC channels for the Cosmos ecosystem. Get everything from token symbols, logos, and IBC denominations for all assets you want to support in your application.

## example

```js
import { assets, chains, ibc } from 'chain-registry';

const assetList = assets.find(({chain_name})=>chain_name==='osmosis');

console.log(assetList);
```

will output:

```js
{
  '$schema': '../assetlist.schema.json',
  chain_name: 'osmosis',
  assets: [
    {
      description: 'The native token of Osmosis',
      denom_units: [Array],
      base: 'uosmo',
      name: 'Osmosis',
      display: 'osmo',
      symbol: 'OSMO',
      logo_URIs: [Object],
      coingecko_id: 'osmosis'
    },
    {
      denom_units: [Array],
      base: 'uion',
      name: 'Ion',
