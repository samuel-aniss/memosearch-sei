```
$ telescope
? [cmd] what do you want to do? (Use arrow keys or type to search)
❯ generate
  transpile
```

Generally, you will want to run commands in this order:

1. generate
2. transpile
### generate

Use the `generate` command to create a new repository with the default proto files. 

```sh
telescope generate
cd ./your-new-project
yarn 
```
### transpile

Finally, run the `transpile` command. 

```sh
telescope transpile
```

You should now seem some `.ts` files generated in `./src`. These are the real source files used in your application.
## programatic usage

```js
import telescope from '@osmonauts/telescope';

// specify proto path and out path
telescope(protoPath, outPath);
```
